This is the case file to model the silica fouling on reverse osmosis membranes. The case is run using the custom solver [silicaROicoFoamSolver](https://github.com/rileyodon/silicaROicoFoamSolver).
## Run Instructions
Can run either a preconstructed mesh using the *./AllrunSpacer4x6* or a mesh constructed in the blockMesh utility with *./Allrun*
